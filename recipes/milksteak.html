        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The milk steak was first mentioned in the fifth season of It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia in 
         “The Waitress Is Getting Married” episode in which the object of Charlie’s obsessive love, the 
         waitress, is discovered to have gotten engaged to Brad Fisher. Worried that Charlie might kill 
         himself (leaving the rest of the gang to do all of his work) or that he might go postal and kill 
          them all, the gang decides to cheer him up by getting him involved in online dating.</p>
        <p>Apparently, the idea for the milk steak was born when one of the show’s writers was talking about 
         a milkshake, but someone thought they said “milk steak” and thought it was hilarious. Charlie once 
          again brings up milk steaks in the thirteenth season in the “Charlie’s Home Alone” episode. Charlie 
          claims that milk steak is one of the brown foods he needs to eat in compliance with his ritual 
         that’s meant to make the Philadelphia Eagles victorious.</p>
